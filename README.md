# Candle-Island
A tile based C++ game using the SFML library.

First stage (9/11/2022):
Drew a map as a vector, made a tile sheet with four different tiles.
Player character can move around with the WASD keys. Map class houses a text file parsing function that currently doesn't work properly.
No collision detection, camera movement, or really any mechanics at all yet.
